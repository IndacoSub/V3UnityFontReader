# V3UnityFontReader
W.I.P. font "reader" for the Danganronpa V3 Unity-based ports.

This tool is licensed under the ISC License (https://github.com/IndacoSub/V3UnityFontReader/blob/main/LICENSE).

Contributions and bug/issue-reporting are welcome and appreciated.

# Usage
You'll first need to extract the Texture2D (.png) and the MonoBehaviour (.txt) of the fonts you want to "read".

You can do so using "UABEA" (https://github.com/nesrak1/UABEA).

Once you extracted those, you can simply open them using the buttons.
